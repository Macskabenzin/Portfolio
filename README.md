# Portfolio

I mainly programmed in HTML/CSS/JS so far, but I have plans for the future.<br />
I started to learn about Node.JS & Sveltekit.<br />

My projects are the following:<br />

## Total-Points

  <br />
  STATUS: FINISHED<br />

## Naval Nonsense

A round based webgame. This is my very first bigger dream project.<br />
<br />
Goal: <br />

- Create a webgame and learn the necessary skills to do it<br />
- Practise the current limits for AI supported tools (picture AI, sound AI etc.)<br />
- Have fun while doing it and make an amazing game :)<br />
  <br />
  STATUS: IN-PROGRESS (so far, the techs are selected & the static content is created)<br />

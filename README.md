I mainly programmed in HTML/CSS/JS so far, but I have plans for the future.
I started to learn about Node.JS & React.

I didn't feel the need to copy here the tutorials I finished based on Udemy courses. I just provide below these repositories:

My projects are the following:


HTML/CSS/JS

Project name: calculator
Goal: Learn the basics how HTML/CSS/JS connects with each other. 
Add comments: I used a simple "eval" command to calculate which is a bit cheating I guess. But I wanted to keep it simple.

Project name: elevator
Goal: Learn a bit about HTML arrangement options, practicing the async functions in JS & CSS methods
Add comments: I kept the elevator simple, and tilt out any functions till the lift finish it's moving. It might happen that I'll make a more realistic elevator version later on.

Project name: vending machine
Goal: Practice some more about HTML positioning, use objects in JS, use pseudo code and how to keep longer code clean.
Add coments: I wanted to add a timeOut at payment, but it was too complex. Everything has qty 2 inventory, it can run out. It is also counting how much change it has. Changing the Object in JS will update the name, price and code in HTML

---! NOT YET FINISHED !---

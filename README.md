I mainly programmed in HTML/CSS/JS so far, but I have plans for the future.<br />
I started to learn about Node.JS & React.<br />

I didn't feel the need to copy here the tutorials I finished based on Udemy courses. I just provide below these repositories:<br />

My projects are the following:<br />

HTML/CSS/JS(vanilla)<br />

Project name: calculator<br />
Goal: Learn the basics how HTML/CSS/JS connects with each other.<br />
Add comments: I used a simple "eval" command to calculate which is a bit cheating I guess. But I wanted to keep it simple.<br />

Project name: elevator<br />
Goal: Learn a bit about HTML arrangement options, practicing the async functions in JS & CSS methods<br />
Add comments: I kept the elevator simple, and tilt out any functions till the lift finish it's moving. It might happen that I'll make a more realistic elevator version later on.<br />

Project name: vending machine<br />
Goal: Practice some more about HTML positioning, use objects in JS, use pseudo code and how to keep longer code clean.<br />
Add coments: I wanted to add a timeOut at payment, but it was too complex. Everything has qty 2 inventory, it can run out. It is also counting how much change it has. Changing the Object in JS will update the name, price and code in HTML<br />
